# Godot 101 – Zenva Academy Learning Project

Welcome! This repo is my personal playground as I work through the [Godot 101 – Game Engine Foundations](https://academy.zenva.com/course/godot-4-101-game-engine-foundations/) course on Zenva Academy.

## What’s Inside?
- Sampled 2D and 3D scenes
- Materials, sprites, and assets
- GDScript experiments
- My first steps in Godot 4

## Why does this exist?
I’m learning Godot from scratch—expect messy scripts, random experiments, and maybe the occasional “aha!” moment. If you’re also starting out, feel free to poke around or fork for your own practice.
