# Godot 101 – Zenva Academy Learning Project

Welcome! This repo is my personal playground as I work through the [Godot 101 – Game Engine Foundations](https://academy.zenva.com/course/godot-4-101-game-engine-foundations/) course on Zenva Academy.

## What’s Inside?
- Sampled 2D and 3D scenes
- Materials, sprites, and assets
- GDScript experiments
- My first steps in Godot 4

## Why does this exist?
I’m learning Godot from scratch—expect messy scripts, random experiments. If you’re also starting out, feel free to look around.
